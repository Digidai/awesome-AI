# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a documentation/curated list project, not a software project. There are no "versions" in the traditional sense. We continuously update and maintain the content.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Although this is a curated list repository rather than executable code, we take security seriously.

### What to Report

- **Malicious Links**: If you discover that any linked tool/website has been compromised or is distributing malware
- **Phishing Concerns**: If any linked resource appears to be a phishing attempt
- **Credential Exposure**: If you notice any exposed API keys, passwords, or sensitive data in our repository
- **Dependency Issues**: If any linked resources have known security vulnerabilities

### How to Report

**Please report security vulnerabilities privately:**

1. **Email**: Create a private security advisory via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Digidai/awesome-AI/security/advisories/new)
2. **Issue**: For non-sensitive security concerns, open an issue with the `security` label

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Issue Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Depending on severity, we aim to address critical issues within 24-48 hours

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using tools from this list:

1. **Verify Official Sources**: Always access tools through their official websites
2. **Check URLs**: Be cautious of typosquatting (e.g., `openai.com` vs `0penai.com`)
3. **Read Privacy Policies**: Understand how each tool handles your data
4. **Protect API Keys**: Never share your API keys publicly
5. **Use Strong Authentication**: Enable 2FA where available

## Link Verification

We perform automated weekly link checks using [lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action) to detect:
- Broken links
- Redirects to suspicious domains
- Certificate issues

## Acknowledgments

We thank the security research community for helping keep this project safe.
